# Implementation Notes
* I used the [Plato theme from Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/plato-responsive-bootstrap-website-template/) because it looked clean and reasonably close to my desired end product.
  * I don't know how smart a choice that was. I learned quickly that tweaking one element (eg, making the header narrower) frequently had unintended consequences (eg, screwing up how it looked on smaller screens). Live and learn!
  * Note to self: Bootstrapify that [woeful bio page. eurgh](https://ekenigsberg.github.io).
